# copycat

Copycat is an amateur skeleton-tracking game that uses MS Kinect and MS XNA framework (no longer being developed as of 2020). The game was developed for EECS 481 at Umich in 2013 and designed for autistic children at CS Mott Children's Hospital. Here is the archived [installer](https://github.com/rsyamil/copycat/blob/master/CopyCat-Final-Release.zip) for Windows 8.

The game takes input from the player by tracking gestures and has multiple levels with different themes. Gameplay is very simple - player has to move around the Kinect sensor play area to collect tokens that will fall from the top of the screen. The skeleton-tracking functionality of MS Kinect tracks the player's body. The goals of the player are to collect as many tokens as possible and to mimic the (copy)cat's pose displayed on the screen.
